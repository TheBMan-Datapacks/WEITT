# Wawla
Wawla(What Are We Looking At) is a Minecraft 1.13 datapack API based off of the Mod Waila. This API is optional on any pack that supports
it, meaning it is the players choice to use it or not

# How Does It Work?
A player will spawn with a book named wawla(if they lose the book, they need to type /trigger wawla set 1}, and if they hold it, whatever
supported block they look at will tell the name, and what pack it is from on the actionbar. The datapack comes with support for many items
in vanilla Minecraft, but not all, because it is meant for datapacks. If you are interested in adding wawla support for your datapack, 
please check the wiki.
